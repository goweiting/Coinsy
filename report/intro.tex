% In this report, we will describe the \hyperlink{method}{methods} we used, \hyperlink{result}{results} of our coin counter - Coinsy, followed by \hyperlink{discussion}{discussions} on the program. The code for coinsy is attached in the \hyperlink{appendix}{appendix}.

\par
To recognise and count the coins in an image, Coinsy, have three subtasks: 1) Image processing, 2) Object recognition, and 3) Classifiation (also counting).
For Coinsy to be a proficient counter, we have to first train it. The processes that Coinsy goes through for training differs from evaluation as described in \href{trgVSeval}{figure \ref*{trgVSeval}}. We will describe her training in the next section - \hyperlink{method}{methodology}, and her \hyperlink{resut}{evaluation results} after. Lastly, we conclude with a \hyperlink{discussion}{discussion on Coinsy performance}.

In the following subsections, we give an overview of the operation pipeline for each subtasks.

\subsection{Image Processing}
For all images that Coinsy receives, a series of preprocessing will be carried our for images to be comparable, followed by background subtraction and image segmentation. The output of this task are the The background is built using
